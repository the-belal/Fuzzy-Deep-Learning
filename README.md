" Fuzzy-Deep-Learning-for-Image-Classification" was my university last year thesis project. It was a joint project wherw Saikat Sharma was my partner completing this research supervised by Md. Mosaddik Hasan Sir (Associate Professor, Dept. of CSE, MBSTU).

About the thesis:

Generally Convolutional Neural Networks is an artificial learning system for image classification which uses convolution operation for feature extraction and pooling operation for dimensionality reduction. Sometimes conventional pooling operation results in the loss of information and does not minimize the uncertainty generated from the input layer to the feature maps of the hidden layers through convolutions. Here we are proposing a novel pooling operation based on (type-1) fuzzy sets  to reduce uncertainty. We implemented it in the context of image classification. The accuracy of the proposed model shows that fuzzy based pooling operation performs better than the standard pooling techniques such as max and average pooling which helps to improve the performance of CNN.
